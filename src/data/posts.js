                excerpt: 'The ocean chose . . . my daughter (?) My three-year-old daughter has recently been on a Moana kick...',
                content: `<h2>The ocean chose . . . my daughter (?)</h2>

<p>My three-year-old daughter has recently been on a Moana kick (yes, the character from Disney Movie). It is <em>not</em> casual. When she's in the zone, she <em>is</em> Moana. If I call her name, she'll flip around in her full islander outfit, heroically brandishing some kind of stick for a paddle, and retort:</p>

<p>"No, Maui! I'm Moana! And <em>we</em> need to fight Te Kā!"</p>

<p>Her stuffed kitty becomes either "Pua" or "Heyhey," and she is relentlessly determined to fulfill her mission–bestowed by the ocean itself–to restore the heart of Te Fiti.</p>

<p>Now, this is totally age-appropriate imaginative play, but it's also incredible how much determination and confidence this play-identity brings out in my tiny daughter.</p>

<p>Identities are powerful.</p>

<h2>Your Identity as a Child of God</h2>

<p>But what if it weren't a fantasy? Confidence in who you are can unlock lasting peace and nearly boundless potential.</p>

<p>Here's a foundational truth that can give you this confidence.</p>

<p><strong>You. Are. God's. Child.<br>His Daughter or His Son.</strong></p>

<p>This isn't speculation. When Christ Himself was accused of masquerading as the son of God, He pointed His accusers back to their own scriptures to remind them of their own potential: [It's not just me!] "Ye [yourselves] are gods, children of the most High" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p34#p34">John 10:34</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/82?lang=eng&id=p6#p6">Psalm 82:6</a>).</p>

<p>Yes, we are talking about the same God who "created the heaven and the earth" and who has "all power" and "all knowledge," and who is infinitely <em>good</em>, among a lot of other things we could say (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11">1 Chronicles 29:11-12</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p20-p22#p20">Daniel 2:20-22</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1">D&C 38:1-3</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Mosiah 4:9</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3">Mosiah 5:3</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>Yes. That person is your father. Your parent. Who loves you and who wants your happiness. This identity as a child of God is the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng">most important identity</a><sup>1</sup> you will ever have, according to a prophet of God.</p>

<p>Think for a second what this actually means! To help, I'm going to quote an apostle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That truth is breathtaking! Stunning! And it is not figurative . . . You really are His cherished daughter. You really are His precious son. And the path you are on is His plan of happiness. With His omniscient love, He knows exactly who you were before you were sent to earth and what you have experienced so far in your mortal life, and He has mercifully planned for your every tomorrow. And oh, how He yearns to one day have you return to Him, to receive the supreme intent of all His beautiful gifts, eternal life with Him.</p>

<p>- Elder Patrick Kearon, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/55kearon?lang=eng"><em>Receive His Gift</em></a>, April 2025</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>But what does this mean exactly?</h2>

<p>In that quote, Elder<sup>2</sup> Kearon said some things that might sound surprising, including the fact that God has a "plan of happiness," and that he knew you "before you were sent to earth."</p>

<p>When we say that God is your father, it's important to clarify that He is the father of your spirit. This mortal body won't last forever, but your spirit is a part of you that existed before you were born and will continue after you die. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Hebrews 12:9</a>).</p>

<p>Ancient scriptures are filled with people—from Moses on a mountain to Jesus teaching the crowds—who were reminded of this divine potential. Here are a few examples:</p>

<h3>You lived with God before you came to Earth</h3>

<p>"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). The Lord gave these bold words to a stunned soon-to-be prophet Jeremiah, who likely was only a teenager when he had this encounter with the Lord around 627 BC. This isn't unique to Jerimiah, it's true for you and all of us!</p>

<p>Modern prophets clarify what has been known for centuries–that "even before [we] were born, [we] received [our] first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come [to the Earth] in the due time of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng&id=p56#p56">D&C 138:56</a>).</p>

<p>It's this same sacred idea that poet William Wordsworth captured when he wrote that "trailing clouds of glory do we come from God, who is our home" (Ode: Intimations of Immortality<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>There is much more to say about this, but know for now that God knew us and loved us before we came here, and that this experience on Earth is an important step we chose to take in learning to become more like our Father.</p>

<h3>Your spirit knows where it came from</h3>

<p>But how could anyone possibly believe this? The Apostle Paul told the Romans that "[God's Holy] Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p16-p17#p16">Romans 8:16-17</a>).</p>

<p>Paul's incredible observation is that God is reaching out directly to your eternal self to tell you who you are. In quiet, peaceful moments you can know in your mind and feel in your heart that you are not an anonymous accident in a cold universe. You are deeply loved by your Father in Heaven.</p>

<p>Like many others, I feel the pull of this message when I gaze into the stars from the Santa Cruz Mountains, or I see the sun set over the ocean from the cliffs near Pacifica, or look up from a forest floor into a cluster of sequoias, but I also feel it in the hug I give to my daughters, or in quiet of my bedside as I pray to connect with God directly and tell Him what is on my mind.</p>

<p>But Paul also shares a startling implication. As a child of God, God wants you to <em>inherit</em> all that He has–all the blessings that He enjoys. He lives for your <em>happiness</em>. This earth was made for <em>you</em>. Everything that He does and everything He has said is to bless you and His other children (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p24-p33#p24">2 Nephi 26:24-33</a>).</p>

<h3>Your identity gives you power and purpose</h3>

<p>So how does this affect my life? Well, that depends on whether you <em>let</em> it change you.</p>

<p>Here's a quick illustration from another Disney Film (remember, I have young kids). Simba from <em>The Lion King</em> thought he had it made. He lived in a beautiful place. He had friends who accepted him. He had "no worries" to speak of. But when his childhood friend Nala showed up and asked him to save his former home from his conniving uncle, Simba was pained and angry.</p>

<p>His life changed immediately and permanently when he was reminded who he was. His murdered father Mufasa (in the booming voice of the late James Earl Jones) essentially told him:</p>

<p>"I know you love me, but you've forgotten me. If you remembered who I really am, you would have remembered that you were born to become something more than this! Sure, you can chill in the jungle and eat bugs with your friends, but you have a destiny and a purpose. That purpose is to be a king."</p>

<p>Once Simba got this, he didn't have to be persuaded anymore. He knew what he needed to do next, and he didn't look back.</p>

<p>This is the change that God hopes will take place in each of us. In a book of scripture called the Pearl of Great Price, the ancient prophet Moses is recorded as having a life-changing Simba-like experience when God shows Moses the extent of his countless creations and drops a bombshell by telling him in same vision "thou art my son . . . and I have a work for three" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p4,p6#p4">Moses 1:4,6</a>). Moses was floored by this revelation, which left him wondering and physically drained. But Satan took advantage of that moment to attack Moses, and despite a rage that shook the earth and filled Moses with dread and fear, Moses called out to God and summoned strength in the knowledge of His relationship with Him. "I am a son of God," he pressed, "in the similitude of his Only Begotten . . . get thee hence[!]" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p13-p22#p13">Moses 1:13-22</a>).</p>

<p>No doubt this same knowledge enabled Moses to fulfil the mission he was called to take on, of taking the Israelites out of Egypt, giving them God's law, and establishing them as a people in the process.</p>

<h2>Knowing who you are can change your life today</h2>

<p>Like in these examples, we also have a royal lineage. The apostle Paul wrote that we are actually "strangers and pilgrims on the earth" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13">Hebrews 11:13</a>)—our true home lies beyond this life that we know. Our destiny is grander than we can imagine. and our Father devotes his entire existence to helping us towards it. Seeing life in this way empowers us to live up to this potential.</p>

<p>Here are a few very important ways your life can change today.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You can always have help:</strong> The creator of the universe is your father! He loves you and wants you to be happy. He hasn't set you up for failure. You can talk to Him and receive help, assurance, power, and comfort at any time about anything. The prophet Isaiah said that when we approach God correctly, "[we can] call, and the Lord [will] answer; [we can] cry, and he [will] say, Here I am" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Isaiah 58:9</a>). Connection with God is real (lots more to say here later).</li>

<li><strong>You can handle any feedback or criticism:</strong> As a child of God, your inherent, eternal worth can't be changed by anyone. Criticism (whether about your personal life, your work, your parenting, or something else) can be heard with a calmer heart. Your identity isn't threatened by a temporary failure, allowing you to accept constructive feedback more easily and keep trying.</li>

<li><strong>You are not your worst mistake:</strong> The people around us sometimes judge us by our lowest moment, but God doesn't. That painful thing you did is not your whole story. The divinity inside you thrives on changing, growing, becoming. God, your father, will help you. Your story is ahead of you to finish, and it has incredible potential.</li>

<li><strong>Empathy becomes easier; enemies vanish:</strong> When we look at someone through the lens of their eternal identity, we stop seeing an opponent or a statistic. We see a brother or a sister who needs encouragement and companionship on the same journey home. God understands and loves your impossible relative, each terrible driver, that jerk at work, and all others more deeply than we can now understand. Just remembering this can allow us to take a deep breath and see more compassionately the whole person. We all joined the same team, and there's an incredible future possible for everyone you've ever met (more on this below<sup>4</sup>).</li>

<li><strong>Your talents become a greater responsibility–and joy:</strong> You see your skills—whether it's nursing, listening, coding, comforting a friend, or cooking—as gifts from God intended to bring happiness and to help God's other children along their journey. This isn't just for self-promotion, career advancement, or to merely fill our free time. This changes a hobby or a love into a meaningful chance to contribute.</li>

<li><strong>You can end the rat race and take the long view:</strong> Knowing your true home and destiny are eternal, the frenetic pursuit of validation, popularity, titles, the "right" friends, net worth, or the accumulation of things loses its urgency and luster. How you spend your time becomes measured against things that last longer: the quality of your most cherished relationships, the strength of your character you are building, and the goodness you share with the world. This long view provides deep peace and allows you to take full ownership of and greater fulfillment in where your time goes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a perfect parent, God wants so badly for His children to come home to Him and to find joy in the process. Because he knows what we are capable of, He sets very high expectations while simultaneously offering infinite compassion, meeting us exactly where we are.</p>

<p>Knowing this idea sheds some important light on why Jesus Christ's mission is so beautiful and necessary. My (current) favorite title of Jesus is "Immanuel" – which means "God with us (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Christ came to <em>be with us</em>–to show us who we really are and to bridge the gap between our broken, imperfect reality and the glorious potential we all have as children of a Father in heaven. Because of Him, our mistakes, challenges, and even death itself don't have to hold us back when we understand where we're ultimately going and how to progress toward it.</p>

<p>Again, there is much more to talk about with all of this, but a strong step that anyone can take right now is to remember who you are and to remember who everyone else is, too. When we do that, we can practice the two great commandments (loving God and loving our neighbor) with increased understanding and compassion. In the process we can discover, to our surprise and joy, that God has more in mind for us than we ever imagined for ourselves.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>As President Russell M. Nelson has taught, our most important identity is that of a child of God, followed by being a child of the covenant, and finally, a disciple of Jesus Christ. These identities transcend all others. I highly recommend reading his full address on this very important topic here (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng">Choices for Eternity</a>, Russel M. Nelson, 2022).</li>

<li>"Elder" is not Elder Patrick Kearon's first name; it's a title used with Apostles and some other leaders in Christ's church. It is also used with Missionaries, who share something in common with Apostles and some others–they are sent out to testify of Jesus Christ. There is much more to say on this, but it is important to note that the title "Elder" was likewise given to leaders with special authority and responsibilities as teh Church of Jesus Christ expanded after Christ's resurrection (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/20?lang=eng&id=p17#p17">Acts 20:17</a> or <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p7#p1">1 Timothy 3:1–7</a>).</li>

<li>Wordsworth's Ode is an exploration of the soul's pre-mortal existence. He writes that the child retains an intuitive connection to the divine, seeing the world "Apparelled in celestial light." As the child matures, this visionary gleam fades into the "light of common day," but the adult gains a deeper "philosophic mind" informed by the memory of that lost glory. It is a fight to remember who we are, and unless we are actively reminding ourselves, we will naturally tend to forget, but our divine origins stay with us nevertheless. It's a beautiful illustration of this idea (<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45536/ode-intimations-of-immortality-from-recollections-of-early-childhood">Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood</a>, William Wordsworth, 1807).</li>

<li>Remembering also that God wants each of us to become like him and to have what he has, makes this even more mind-blowing. C.S. Lewis put this reality into sharp focus: "It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal" (C.S. Lewis, <a href="https://www.doxaweb.com/assets/weight_of_glory.pdf">"The Weight of Glory"</a>, 1942).<br><br>Imagine what happens If we always go through life seeing people this way! We couldn't justify treating anyone poorly. The late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks taught that since we are created in the image of God, to dishonour a human being is to dishonour God Himself, and that harming another human being could even be thought of as a form of sacrilege–disrespecting something deeply holy. It doesn't matter if I think my opinion in daily life, politics or anything else is 100% correct and I think theirs is 100% wrong. It doesn't matter if their life choices offend me. Hateful tactics, contempt, or dismissiveness aren't just bad politics or bad manners; they are a direct disgrace to the Father who loves us both.</li>

                title: 'Bạn thực sự là ai?',
                excerpt: 'Đại dương đã chọn . . . con gái tôi (?) Con gái ba tuổi của tôi gần đây rất thích Moana...',
                content: `<h2>Đại Dương Đã Chọn... Con Gái Tôi (?)</h2>

<p>Gần đây con gái ba tuổi của tôi rất mê nhân vật Moana (đúng vậy, là nhân vật trong phim Disney). Mối quan tâm này <em>không hề</em> đơn giản. Khi nhập vai, con bé <em>chính là</em> Moana. Nếu tôi gọi tên con, con bé sẽ quay lại trong bộ trang phục thổ dân đầy đủ, hùng dũng vung một cây gậy thay mái chèo, và đáp lại:</p>

<p>"Không, Maui! Con là Moana! Và <em>chúng ta</em> cần phải chiến đấu với Te Kā!"</p>

<p>Con mèo nhồi bông của con bé trở thành "Pua" hoặc "Heyhey," và con bé kiên quyết hoàn thành sứ mệnh–được chính đại dương ban tặng–là khôi phục trái tim của Te Fiti.</p>

<p>Đây là một trò chơi giàu trí tưởng tượng hoàn toàn phù hợp với lứa tuổi, nhưng thật đáng kinh ngạc khi vai trò giả định này đã mang lại bao nhiêu quyết tâm và sự tự tin cho cô con gái bé bỏng của tôi.</p>

<p>Bản sắc (danh tính) rất mạnh mẽ.</p>

<h2>Bản Sắc Của Bạn Là Con Cái Đức Chúa Trời</h2>

<p>Nhưng nếu đó không phải là một điều tưởng tượng thì sao? Sự tự tin vào con người thật của bạn có thể mở khóa sự bình an vĩnh cửu và tiềm năng gần như vô hạn.</p>

<p>Đây là một lẽ thật căn bản có thể mang lại cho bạn sự tự tin này.</p>

<p><strong>Bạn. Là. Con. Cái. Của. Đức. Chúa. Trời.<br> Là Con Gái hoặc Con Trai của Ngài.</strong></p>

<p>Đây không phải là suy đoán. Khi chính Đấng Ky Tô bị buộc tội giả mạo làm Con Đức Chúa Trời, Ngài đã chỉ những người buộc tội mình trở lại với thánh thư của họ để nhắc nhở họ về tiềm năng của chính họ: [Không chỉ riêng Ta!] "Chính các [ngươi] là các thần, là con cái của Đấng Tối Cao" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p34#p34">Giăng 10:34</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/82?lang=eng&id=p6#p6">Thi Thiên 82:6</a>).</p>

<p>Vâng, chúng ta đang nói về chính Đức Chúa Trời, Đấng đã "sáng tạo nên trời và đất," Đấng có "mọi quyền năng" và "mọi sự hiểu biết," và Đấng nhân <em>lành</em> vô hạn, cùng với vô số điều khác mà chúng ta có thể nói (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1">Sáng Thế Ký 1:1</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11">1 Sử Ký 29:11-12</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p20-p22#p20">Đa Ni Ên 2:20-22</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1">GLGƯ 38:1-3</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Mô Si A 4:9</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3">Mô Si A 5:3</a>, v.v.).</p>

<p>Vâng. Đấng ấy là Cha của bạn. Là Đấng sinh thành của bạn. Đấng yêu thương bạn và mong muốn hạnh phúc của bạn. Theo một vị tiên tri của Thượng Đế, bản sắc là con cái Đức Chúa Trời là <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng">bản sắc quan trọng nhất</a><sup>1</sup> bạn từng có.</p>

<p>Hãy suy nghĩ một chút xem điều này thực sự có ý nghĩa gì! Để giúp bạn, tôi sẽ trích dẫn lời một vị sứ đồ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lẽ thật đó thật đáng kinh ngạc! Tuyệt vời! Và nó không phải là theo nghĩa bóng... Bạn thực sự là con gái yêu quý của Ngài. Bạn thực sự là con trai quý giá của Ngài. Và con đường bạn đang đi là kế hoạch hạnh phúc của Ngài. Với tình yêu toàn tri của Ngài, Ngài biết rõ bạn là ai trước khi được gửi xuống trần gian và những gì bạn đã trải qua trong cuộc sống hữu diệt cho đến nay, và Ngài đã nhân từ sắp đặt cho mọi ngày mai của bạn. Và ôi, Ngài khao khát một ngày nào đó bạn sẽ trở về với Ngài, để nhận được mục đích tối thượng của tất cả những món quà tuyệt vời của Ngài, là cuộc sống vĩnh cửu với Ngài.</p>

<p>- Ông Patrick Kearon, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/55kearon?lang=eng"><em>Hãy Tiếp Nhận Ân Tứ Của Ngài</em></a>, Tháng Tư 2025</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Nhưng điều này chính xác có nghĩa là gì?</h2>

<p>Trong đoạn trích đó, Ông<sup>2</sup> Kearon đã nói một vài điều có thể nghe có vẻ ngạc nhiên, bao gồm cả việc Đức Chúa Trời có một "kế hoạch hạnh phúc" và Ngài biết bạn "trước khi bạn được gửi xuống trần gian."</p>

<p>Khi chúng ta nói rằng Đức Chúa Trời là Cha của bạn, điều quan trọng là phải làm rõ rằng Ngài là cha của linh hồn bạn. Thân thể hữu diệt này sẽ không tồn tại mãi mãi, nhưng linh hồn là một phần của bạn đã tồn tại trước khi bạn sinh ra và sẽ tiếp tục tồn tại sau khi bạn chết. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Hê Bơ Rơ 12:9</a>).</p>

<p>Thánh thư cổ xưa đầy rẫy những người—từ Môi Se trên núi đến Chúa Giê Su giảng dạy đám đông—đã được nhắc nhở về tiềm năng thiêng liêng này. Dưới đây là một vài ví dụ:</p>

<h3>Bạn đã sống với Đức Chúa Trời trước khi đến Trái Đất</h3>

<p>"Trước khi Ta tạo hình ngươi trong lòng mẹ, Ta đã biết ngươi; trước khi ngươi sinh ra, Ta đã biệt riêng ngươi, và lập ngươi làm tiên tri cho các nước" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5">Giê Rê Mi 1:5</a>). Chúa đã ban những lời mạnh mẽ này cho nhà tiên tri Giê Rê Mi sắp được gọi, người có lẽ chỉ là một thiếu niên khi ông có cuộc gặp gỡ này với Chúa vào khoảng năm 627 TCN. Điều này không chỉ đúng với Giê Rê Mi, nó cũng đúng với bạn và tất cả chúng ta!</p>

<p>Các vị tiên tri hiện đại làm rõ điều đã được biết đến qua nhiều thế kỷ–rằng "ngay cả trước khi [chúng ta] sinh ra, [chúng ta] đã nhận được những bài học đầu tiên trong thế giới linh hồn và được chuẩn bị để đến [Trái Đất] vào thời điểm thích hợp của Chúa" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng&id=p56#p56">GLGƯ 138:56</a>).</p>

<p>Chính ý tưởng thiêng liêng này đã được nhà thơ William Wordsworth nắm bắt khi ông viết rằng "chúng ta đến từ Đức Chúa Trời, là nhà của chúng ta, mang theo những đám mây vinh quang" (Ode: Intimations of Immortality<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>Còn nhiều điều để nói về điều này, nhưng bây giờ hãy biết rằng Đức Chúa Trời đã biết và yêu thương chúng ta trước khi chúng ta đến đây, và kinh nghiệm này trên Trái Đất là một bước quan trọng mà chúng ta đã chọn để học cách trở nên giống Cha chúng ta hơn.</p>

<h3>Linh hồn bạn biết nó đến từ đâu</h3>

<p>Nhưng làm thế nào bất cứ ai có thể tin điều này? Sứ Đồ Phao Lô đã nói với người La Mã rằng "chính [Thánh] Linh của Đức Chúa Trời làm chứng cho lòng chúng ta rằng chúng ta là con cái Đức Chúa Trời. Lại nếu là con cái, thì cũng là người thừa kế—người thừa kế của Đức Chúa Trời và đồng thừa kế với Đấng Ky Tô" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p16-p17#p16">Rô Ma 8:16-17</a>).</p>

<p>Nhận xét đáng kinh ngạc của Phao Lô là Đức Chúa Trời đang trực tiếp vươn tới con người vĩnh cửu của bạn để nói cho bạn biết bạn là ai. Trong những khoảnh khắc tĩnh lặng, bình yên, bạn có thể biết trong tâm trí và cảm nhận trong lòng rằng bạn không phải là một tai nạn vô danh trong một vũ trụ lạnh lẽo. Bạn được Cha Thiên Thượng yêu thương sâu sắc.</p>

<p>Giống như nhiều người khác, tôi cảm thấy thông điệp này thu hút khi tôi nhìn vào các vì sao từ Dãy núi Santa Cruz, hoặc tôi thấy mặt trời lặn trên đại dương từ những vách đá gần Pacifica, hoặc ngước nhìn lên từ nền rừng vào một cụm cây sequoia, nhưng tôi cũng cảm thấy điều đó trong cái ôm tôi dành cho các con gái mình, hoặc trong sự tĩnh lặng bên giường khi tôi cầu nguyện để kết nối trực tiếp với Đức Chúa Trời và nói với Ngài những gì trong tâm trí tôi.</p>

<p>Nhưng Phao Lô cũng chia sẻ một hàm ý đáng kinh ngạc. Là con cái Đức Chúa Trời, Ngài muốn bạn <em>thừa hưởng</em> tất cả những gì Ngài có–tất cả các phước lành mà Ngài hưởng. Ngài sống vì <em>hạnh phúc</em> của bạn. Trái Đất này được tạo ra vì <em>bạn</em>. Mọi điều Ngài làm và mọi điều Ngài đã phán đều là để ban phước cho bạn và các con cái khác của Ngài (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p24-p33#p24">Nê Phi Thứ Hai 26:24-33</a>).</p>

<h3>Bản sắc của bạn mang lại cho bạn quyền năng và mục đích</h3>

<p>Vậy điều này ảnh hưởng đến cuộc sống của tôi như thế nào? Chà, điều đó phụ thuộc vào việc bạn có <em>để</em> nó thay đổi bạn hay không.</p>

<p>Đây là một minh họa nhanh từ một bộ phim Disney khác (nhớ rằng, tôi có con nhỏ). Simba trong phim <em>Vua Sư Tử</em> nghĩ rằng mọi thứ đã đâu vào đấy. Cậu sống ở một nơi tươi đẹp. Cậu có những người bạn chấp nhận cậu. Cậu không có "lo lắng" nào đáng kể. Nhưng khi người bạn thời thơ ấu Nala xuất hiện và yêu cầu cậu cứu ngôi nhà cũ khỏi người chú xảo quyệt của mình, Simba đã đau khổ và tức giận.</p>

<p>Cuộc đời cậu thay đổi ngay lập tức và vĩnh viễn khi cậu được nhắc nhở về con người thật của mình. Người cha bị sát hại của cậu, Mufasa (với giọng nói vang vọng của cố James Earl Jones) về cơ bản đã nói với cậu:</p>

<p>"Ta biết con yêu ta, nhưng con đã quên ta. Nếu con nhớ ta thực sự là ai, con sẽ nhớ rằng con được sinh ra để trở thành một điều gì đó hơn thế này! Chắc chắn, con có thể thư giãn trong rừng và ăn côn trùng với bạn bè, nhưng con có một số phận và một mục đích. Mục đích đó là trở thành một vị vua."</p>

<p>Khi Simba hiểu được điều này, cậu không cần phải bị thuyết phục nữa. Cậu biết mình cần phải làm gì tiếp theo, và cậu không hề nhìn lại.</p>

<p>Đây là sự thay đổi mà Đức Chúa Trời hy vọng sẽ diễn ra trong mỗi chúng ta. Trong một cuốn thánh thư gọi là Trân Châu Vô Giá, nhà tiên tri Môi Se thời xưa được ghi lại là đã có một kinh nghiệm thay đổi cuộc đời giống như Simba khi Đức Chúa Trời cho Môi Se thấy mức độ vô số các tạo vật của Ngài và tiết lộ một điều chấn động khi phán với ông trong cùng một khải tượng: "ngươi là con trai ta. . . và ta có một việc cho ngươi làm" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p4,p6#p4">Môi Se 1:4,6</a>). Môi Se choáng váng trước sự mặc khải này, khiến ông kinh ngạc và kiệt sức về thể chất. Nhưng Sa Tan đã lợi dụng khoảnh khắc đó để tấn công Môi Se, và bất chấp cơn thịnh nộ làm rung chuyển trái đất và khiến Môi Se đầy sợ hãi và kinh hoàng, Môi Se đã kêu cầu Đức Chúa Trời và triệu hồi sức mạnh trong sự hiểu biết về mối quan hệ của ông với Ngài. Ông nhấn mạnh: "Tôi là con trai của Đức Chúa Trời, theo hình ảnh của Đấng Độc Sinh của Ngài... hãy đi khỏi đây!" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p13-p22#p13">Môi Se 1:13-22</a>).</p>

<p>Không nghi ngờ gì, chính sự hiểu biết này đã giúp Môi Se hoàn thành sứ mệnh mà ông được kêu gọi đảm nhận, đó là đưa dân Y Sơ Ra Ên ra khỏi Ai Cập, ban cho họ luật pháp của Đức Chúa Trời và thiết lập họ thành một dân tộc trong tiến trình đó.</p>

<h2>Việc biết bạn là ai có thể thay đổi cuộc sống của bạn hôm nay</h2>

<p>Giống như trong những ví dụ này, chúng ta cũng có một dòng dõi hoàng gia. Sứ Đồ Phao Lô đã viết rằng chúng ta thực sự là "khách và người trọ" trên đất (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13">Hê Bơ Rơ 11:13</a>)—ngôi nhà thực sự của chúng ta nằm ngoài cuộc đời này mà chúng ta biết. Số phận của chúng ta vĩ đại hơn những gì chúng ta có thể tưởng tượng, và Cha chúng ta dành toàn bộ sự tồn tại của Ngài để giúp chúng ta đạt được điều đó. Nhìn cuộc sống theo cách này giúp chúng ta có sức mạnh để sống xứng đáng với tiềm năng này.</p>

<p>Dưới đây là một vài cách rất quan trọng mà cuộc sống của bạn có thể thay đổi ngay hôm nay.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bạn luôn có thể nhận được sự giúp đỡ:</strong> Đấng sáng tạo vũ trụ là Cha của bạn! Ngài yêu thương bạn và muốn bạn hạnh phúc. Ngài không sắp đặt để bạn thất bại. Bạn có thể nói chuyện với Ngài và nhận được sự giúp đỡ, sự bảo đảm, quyền năng và sự an ủi bất cứ lúc nào về bất cứ điều gì. Tiên tri Ê Sai nói rằng khi chúng ta đến gần Đức Chúa Trời một cách đúng đắn, "[chúng ta] có thể kêu cầu, và Đức Giê Hô Va [sẽ] đáp lời; [chúng ta] có thể kêu van, và Ngài [sẽ] phán rằng: Có Ta đây" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Ê Sai 58:9</a>). Sự kết nối với Đức Chúa Trời là có thật (còn nhiều điều để nói ở đây sau này).</li>

<li><strong>Bạn có thể xử lý mọi phản hồi hoặc lời chỉ trích:</strong> Là con cái Đức Chúa Trời, giá trị nội tại, vĩnh cửu của bạn không thể bị thay đổi bởi bất cứ ai. Lời chỉ trích (dù là về cuộc sống cá nhân, công việc, việc làm cha mẹ, hay điều gì khác) có thể được lắng nghe với một trái tim bình tĩnh hơn. Bản sắc của bạn không bị đe dọa bởi một thất bại tạm thời, cho phép bạn dễ dàng chấp nhận phản hồi mang tính xây dựng và tiếp tục cố gắng.</li>

<li><strong>Bạn không phải là sai lầm tồi tệ nhất của mình:</strong> Những người xung quanh đôi khi đánh giá chúng ta bằng khoảnh khắc tồi tệ nhất của chúng ta, nhưng Đức Chúa Trời thì không. Điều đau đớn bạn đã làm không phải là toàn bộ câu chuyện của bạn. Sự thiêng liêng bên trong bạn phát triển nhờ sự thay đổi, phát triển, trở thành. Đức Chúa Trời, Cha của bạn, sẽ giúp bạn. Câu chuyện của bạn đang ở phía trước để bạn hoàn thành, và nó có tiềm năng đáng kinh ngạc.</li>

<li><strong>Sự đồng cảm trở nên dễ dàng hơn; kẻ thù biến mất:</strong> Khi chúng ta nhìn một người qua lăng kính bản sắc vĩnh cửu của họ, chúng ta không còn thấy một đối thủ hay một con số thống kê. Chúng ta thấy một người anh em hoặc một người chị em cần sự khích lệ và sự đồng hành trên cùng hành trình về nhà. Đức Chúa Trời hiểu và yêu thương người thân khó chịu của bạn, mỗi người lái xe tồi tệ, tên khó ưa ở nơi làm việc, và tất cả những người khác sâu sắc hơn chúng ta có thể hiểu bây giờ. Chỉ cần nhớ điều này có thể cho phép chúng ta hít một hơi thật sâu và nhìn thấy toàn bộ con người một cách nhân ái hơn. Tất cả chúng ta đều tham gia cùng một đội, và có một tương lai đáng kinh ngạc dành cho tất cả những người bạn từng gặp (thêm về điều này dưới đây<sup>4</sup>).</li>

<li><strong>Tài năng của bạn trở thành một trách nhiệm lớn hơn–và niềm vui:</strong> Bạn nhìn thấy các kỹ năng của mình—cho dù là y tá, lắng nghe, lập trình, an ủi một người bạn, hay nấu ăn—như là những món quà từ Đức Chúa Trời nhằm mang lại hạnh phúc và giúp đỡ các con cái khác của Đức Chúa Trời trên hành trình của họ. Điều này không chỉ dành cho việc tự quảng bá, thăng tiến nghề nghiệp, hoặc chỉ để lấp đầy thời gian rảnh rỗi của chúng ta. Điều này biến một sở thích hoặc một tình yêu thành một cơ hội có ý nghĩa để đóng góp.</li>

<li><strong>Bạn có thể chấm dứt cuộc chạy đua tranh giành và nhìn nhận xa hơn:</strong> Khi biết ngôi nhà và số phận thực sự của bạn là vĩnh cửu, việc theo đuổi điên cuồng sự xác nhận, sự nổi tiếng, danh hiệu, những người bạn "đúng đắn," giá trị tài sản ròng, hoặc sự tích lũy mọi thứ sẽ mất đi sự cấp bách và vẻ hào nhoáng của nó. Cách bạn dành thời gian trở nên được đo lường dựa trên những điều tồn tại lâu hơn: chất lượng của những mối quan hệ thân thiết nhất của bạn, sức mạnh tính cách mà bạn đang xây dựng và lòng tốt mà bạn chia sẻ với thế giới. Quan điểm lâu dài này mang lại sự bình an sâu sắc và cho phép bạn nắm giữ hoàn toàn và đạt được sự mãn nguyện lớn hơn trong việc bạn dành thời gian vào đâu.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Một Vài Suy Nghĩ Cuối Cùng</h2>

<p>Là một bậc cha mẹ hoàn hảo, Đức Chúa Trời rất mong muốn con cái Ngài trở về nhà với Ngài và tìm thấy niềm vui trong quá trình đó. Bởi vì Ngài biết khả năng của chúng ta, Ngài đặt ra những kỳ vọng rất cao đồng thời ban cho lòng trắc ẩn vô hạn, gặp gỡ chúng ta chính xác ở nơi chúng ta đang đứng.</p>

<p>Việc biết ý tưởng này soi sáng một số điều quan trọng về lý do tại sao sứ mệnh của Chúa Giê Su Ky Tô lại đẹp đẽ và cần thiết đến vậy. Danh hiệu (hiện tại) tôi yêu thích nhất của Chúa Giê Su là "Em-ma-nu-ên" – có nghĩa là "Đức Chúa Trời ở cùng chúng ta" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14">Ê Sai 7:14</a>). Đấng Ky Tô đã đến để <em>ở cùng chúng ta</em>–để chỉ cho chúng ta thấy chúng ta thực sự là ai và để bắc cầu khoảng cách giữa thực tại đổ vỡ, không hoàn hảo của chúng ta và tiềm năng vinh quang mà tất cả chúng ta có với tư cách là con cái của một Cha Thiên Thượng. Nhờ Ngài, những sai lầm, thử thách và thậm chí cái chết của chúng ta cũng không cần phải ngăn cản chúng ta khi chúng ta hiểu rốt cuộc mình đang đi đâu và làm thế nào để tiến tới điều đó.</p>

<p>Một lần nữa, còn nhiều điều để nói về tất cả những điều này, nhưng một bước đi mạnh mẽ mà bất cứ ai cũng có thể thực hiện ngay bây giờ là nhớ bạn là ai và nhớ những người khác là ai. Khi chúng ta làm điều đó, chúng ta có thể thực hành hai điều răn lớn (yêu mến Đức Chúa Trời và yêu thương người lân cận) với sự hiểu biết và lòng trắc ẩn gia tăng. Trong quá trình đó, chúng ta có thể khám phá, một cách ngạc nhiên và vui mừng, rằng Đức Chúa Trời có nhiều điều dành cho chúng ta hơn những gì chúng ta từng tưởng tượng cho chính mình.</p>

<h2>Chú Thích</h2>

<ol>
<li>Như Chủ Tịch Russell M. Nelson đã dạy, bản sắc quan trọng nhất của chúng ta là con cái Đức Chúa Trời, tiếp theo là con cái giao ước, và cuối cùng là môn đồ của Chúa Giê Su Ky Tô. Những bản sắc này vượt lên trên tất cả những bản sắc khác. Tôi thực sự khuyên bạn nên đọc bài nói chuyện đầy đủ của ông về chủ đề rất quan trọng này tại đây (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng">Những Lựa Chọn Cho Sự Vĩnh Cửu</a>, Russell M. Nelson, 2022).</li>

<li>Danh xưng "Ông" (hoặc "Anh Cả") không phải là tên riêng của Ông Patrick Kearon; đó là một danh xưng được sử dụng cho các Sứ Đồ và một số lãnh đạo khác trong giáo hội của Đấng Ky Tô. Danh xưng này cũng được sử dụng cho các Truyền Giáo Viên, những người có điểm chung với các Sứ Đồ và một số người khác—họ được gửi đi để làm chứng về Chúa Giê Su Ky Tô. Còn nhiều điều để nói về điều này, nhưng điều quan trọng cần lưu ý là danh xưng "Ông" (hoặc "Anh Cả") cũng được ban cho các lãnh đạo có thẩm quyền và trách nhiệm đặc biệt khi Giáo Hội Các Thánh Hữu Ngày Sau của Chúa Giê Su Ky Tô mở rộng sau sự phục sinh của Đấng Ky Tô (xem <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/20?lang=eng&id=p17#p17">Công Vụ Các Sứ Đồ 20:17</a> hoặc <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p7#p1">1 Ti Mô Thê 3:1–7</a>).</li>

<li>Tác phẩm "Ode" của Wordsworth là sự khám phá về sự tồn tại tiền trần thế của linh hồn. Ông viết rằng đứa trẻ giữ lại một sự kết nối trực giác với thần thánh, nhìn thế giới "khoác lên ánh sáng thiên thượng." Khi đứa trẻ trưởng thành, ánh sáng thị kiến này phai nhạt thành "ánh sáng của ngày thường," nhưng người lớn đạt được một "tâm trí triết lý" sâu sắc hơn được hình thành bởi ký ức về vinh quang đã mất đó. Đó là một cuộc chiến để nhớ chúng ta là ai, và trừ khi chúng ta tích cực nhắc nhở bản thân, chúng ta sẽ tự nhiên có xu hướng quên, nhưng nguồn gốc thiêng liêng của chúng ta vẫn ở lại với chúng ta. Đây là một minh họa đẹp đẽ cho ý tưởng này (<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45536/ode-intimations-of-immortality-from-recollections-of-early-childhood">Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood</a>, William Wordsworth, 1807).</li>

<li>Việc nhớ rằng Đức Chúa Trời cũng muốn mỗi người chúng ta trở nên giống Ngài và có được những gì Ngài có, làm cho điều này thậm chí còn kinh ngạc hơn. C.S. Lewis đã làm nổi bật thực tế này: "Thật là một điều nghiêm trọng khi sống trong một xã hội của những vị thần và nữ thần tiềm năng, phải nhớ rằng người buồn tẻ và kém thú vị nhất mà bạn nói chuyện có thể một ngày nào đó là một tạo vật mà, nếu bạn thấy bây giờ, bạn sẽ bị cám dỗ mạnh mẽ để tôn thờ. . . . Không có người bình thường nào cả. Bạn chưa bao giờ nói chuyện với một người phàm trần đơn thuần" (C.S. Lewis, <a href="https://www.doxaweb.com/assets/weight_of_glory.pdf">"The Weight of Glory"</a>, 1942).<br><br>Hãy tưởng tượng điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu chúng ta luôn sống bằng cách nhìn mọi người theo cách này! Chúng ta không thể biện minh cho việc đối xử tệ với bất cứ ai. Cố Thầy Giám Mục Jonathan Sacks dạy rằng vì chúng ta được tạo dựng theo hình ảnh của Đức Chúa Trời, nên việc làm nhục một con người là làm nhục chính Đức Chúa Trời, và làm hại một con người thậm chí có thể được coi là một hình thức báng bổ—không tôn trọng một điều gì đó thiêng liêng sâu sắc. Không quan trọng nếu tôi nghĩ ý kiến của tôi trong cuộc sống hàng ngày, chính trị hay bất cứ điều gì khác là đúng 100% và tôi nghĩ ý kiến của họ là sai 100%. Không quan trọng nếu những lựa chọn cuộc sống của họ xúc phạm tôi. Chiến thuật thù hận, khinh miệt, hay coi thường không chỉ là chính trị tồi tệ hay cách cư xử tồi tệ; chúng là một sự sỉ nhục trực tiếp đối với Cha, Đấng yêu thương cả hai chúng ta.</li>

            es: {
                title: '¿Quién eres realmente?',
                excerpt: 'El océano eligió . . . a mi hija (?) Mi hija de tres años ha estado recientemente obsesionada con Moana...',
                content: `<h2>El océano eligió... ¿a mi hija (?)</h2>

<p>Mi hija de tres años ha estado recientemente en una <strong>etapa de Moana</strong> (sí, el personaje de la película de Disney). <em>No</em> es algo casual. Cuando está metida en el papel, ella <em>es</em> Moana. Si la llamo por su nombre, dará media vuelta con su traje completo de isleña, blandiendo heroicamente algún tipo de palo a modo de remo, y me replica:</p>

<p>“¡No, Maui! ¡Soy Moana! ¡Y <em>nosotros</em> necesitamos luchar contra Te Kā!”</p>

<p>Su gatito de peluche se convierte en "Púa" o en "Heihei", y ella está incansablemente decidida a cumplir su misión —otorgada por el mismo océano— de restaurar el corazón de Te Fiti.</p>

<p>Aunque esto es un juego imaginativo totalmente apropiado para su edad, es increíble la determinación y la confianza que esta identidad de juego saca a relucir en mi pequeña hija.</p>

<p>Las identidades son poderosas.</p>

<h2>Tu identidad como Hijo(a) de Dios</h2>

<p>Pero ¿y si no fuera una fantasía? La confianza en quién eres puede desbloquear una paz duradera y un potencial casi ilimitado.</p>

<p>Aquí tienes una verdad fundamental que puede darte esa confianza:</p>

<p><strong>Eres. Hijo(a). De. Dios. <br>Su Hija o Su Hijo.</strong></p>

<p>Esto no es una especulación. Cuando el mismo Cristo fue acusado de hacerse pasar por el Hijo de Dios, Él remitió a Sus acusadores a sus propias Escrituras para recordarles su propio potencial: [¡No soy solo yo!] “Vosotros [ustedes mismos] sois dioses, e hijos todos vosotros del Altísimo” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=spa&id=p34#p34">Juan 10:34</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/82?lang=spa&id=p6#p6">Salmos 82:6</a>).</p>

<p>Sí, estamos hablando del mismo Dios que “creó los cielos y la tierra”, que tiene “todo poder” y “todo conocimiento”, y que es infinitamente <em>bueno</em>, entre muchas otras cosas que podríamos decir (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=spa&id=p1#p1">Génesis 1:1</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=spa&id=p11-p12#p11">1 Crónicas 29:11-12</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=spa&id=p20-p22#p20">Daniel 2:20-22</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=spa&id=p1-p3#p1">D. y C. 38:1-3</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=spa&id=p9#p9">Mosíah 4:9</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=spa&id=p3#p3">Mosíah 5:3</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>Sí. Esa persona es tu Padre. Tu progenitor. Que te ama y que desea tu felicidad. Esta identidad como hijo(a) de Dios es la <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=spa">identidad más importante</a><sup>1</sup> que jamás tendrás, según un profeta de Dios.</p>

<p>¡Piensa por un momento lo que esto significa realmente! Para ayudarte, voy a citar a un apóstol:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>¡Esa verdad es impresionante! ¡Asombrosa! Y no es figurativa… Realmente eres Su hija querida. Realmente eres Su hijo preciado. Y el camino por el que vas es Su plan de felicidad. Con Su amor omnisciente, Él sabe exactamente quién eras antes de ser enviado a la tierra y lo que has experimentado hasta ahora en tu vida terrenal, y ha planeado con misericordia cada uno de tus mañanas. Y ¡cuánto anhela que algún día vuelvas a Él, para recibir el propósito supremo de todos Sus hermosos dones, la vida eterna con Él!</p>

<p>- Élder Patrick Kearon, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/55kearon?lang=spa"><em>Reciban Su Don</em></a>, abril de 2025</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Pero, ¿qué significa esto exactamente?</h2>

<p>En esa cita, el Élder<sup>2</sup> Kearon dijo algunas cosas que podrían sonar sorprendentes, incluido el hecho de que Dios tiene un “plan de felicidad” y que te conoció “antes de ser enviado a la tierra”.</p>

<p>Cuando decimos que Dios es tu Padre, es importante aclarar que Él es el Padre de tu espíritu. Este cuerpo mortal no durará para siempre, pero tu espíritu es una parte de ti que existió antes de que nacieras y continuará después de que mueras (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12?lang=spa&id=p9#p9">Hebreos 12:9</a>).</p>

<p>Las Escrituras antiguas están llenas de personas —desde Moisés en una montaña hasta Jesús enseñando a las multitudes— a quienes se les recordó este potencial divino. Aquí tienes algunos ejemplos:</p>

<h3>Viviste con Dios antes de venir a la Tierra</h3>

<p>“Antes que te formase en el vientre, te conocí; y antes que salieses de la matriz, te santifiqué y te di por profeta a las naciones” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=spa&id=p5#p5">Jeremías 1:5</a>). El Señor le dio estas audaces palabras al asombrado profeta Jeremías, quien probablemente era solo un adolescente cuando tuvo este encuentro con el Señor alrededor del 627 a. C. ¡Esto no es exclusivo de Jeremías, es verdad para ti y para todos nosotros!</p>

<p>Los profetas modernos aclaran lo que se ha sabido durante siglos: que “aun antes de nacer, [recibimos] [nuestras] primeras lecciones en el mundo de los espíritus, y [fuimos] preparados para venir [a la Tierra] en el debido tiempo del Señor” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=spa&id=p56#p56">D. y C. 138:56</a>).</p>

<p>Es esta misma idea sagrada la que capturó el poeta William Wordsworth cuando escribió que “trayendo nubes de gloria venimos de Dios, que es nuestro hogar” (Oda: Indicios de Inmortalidad<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>Hay mucho más que decir sobre esto, pero por ahora, debes saber que Dios nos conoció y nos amó antes de que viniéramos aquí, y que esta experiencia en la Tierra es un paso importante que elegimos dar para aprender a ser más como nuestro Padre.</p>

<h3>Tu espíritu sabe de dónde viene</h3>

<p>Pero ¿cómo podría alguien creer esto? El apóstol Pablo dijo a los romanos que “el Espíritu mismo da testimonio a nuestro espíritu de que <strong>somos hijos de Dios</strong>. Y si hijos, también herederos; herederos de Dios y coherederos con Cristo” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=spa&id=p16-p17#p16">Romanos 8:16-17</a>).</p>

<p>La increíble observación de Pablo es que Dios se está acercando directamente a tu ser eterno para decirte quién eres. En momentos de tranquilidad y paz, puedes saber en tu mente y sentir en tu corazón que no eres un accidente anónimo en un universo frío. Eres profundamente amado por tu Padre Celestial.</p>

<p>Al igual que muchos otros, siento el tirón de este mensaje cuando contemplo las estrellas desde las montañas de Santa Cruz, o veo la puesta de sol sobre el océano desde los acantilados cerca de Pacifica, o miro hacia arriba desde el suelo de un bosque hacia un grupo de secuoyas; pero también lo siento en el abrazo que le doy a mis hijas, o en la tranquilidad junto a mi cama mientras oro para conectarme directamente con Dios y contarle lo que tengo en mente.</p>

<p>Pero Pablo también comparte una implicación sorprendente. Como hijo(a) de Dios, Dios quiere que <em>heredes</em> todo lo que Él tiene, todas las bendiciones que Él disfruta. Él vive para tu <em>felicidad</em>. Esta tierra fue hecha para <em>ti</em>. Todo lo que Él hace y todo lo que Él ha dicho es para bendecirte a ti y a Sus otros hijos (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=spa&id=p24-p33#p24">2 Nefi 26:24-33</a>).</p>

<h3>Tu identidad te da poder y propósito</h3>

<p>Entonces, ¿cómo afecta esto a mi vida? Bueno, eso depende de si <em>dejas</em> que te cambie.</p>

<p>Aquí hay una ilustración rápida de otra película de Disney (recuerda, tengo niños pequeños). Simba de <em>El Rey León</em> pensaba que lo tenía todo. Vivía en un lugar hermoso. Tenía amigos que lo aceptaban. No tenía “ninguna preocupación” de la que hablar. Pero cuando su amiga de la infancia Nala apareció y le pidió que salvara su antiguo hogar de su tío intrigante, Simba se sintió dolido y enojado.</p>

<p>Su vida cambió inmediata y permanentemente cuando se le recordó quién era. Su padre asesinado, Mufasa (con la voz atronadora del difunto James Earl Jones), esencialmente le dijo:</p>

<p>“Sé que me amas, pero me has olvidado. Si recordaras quién soy realmente, ¡habrías recordado que naciste para ser algo más que esto! Claro, puedes relajarte en la selva y comer bichos con tus amigos, pero tienes un destino y un propósito. Ese propósito es ser un rey”.</p>

<p>Una vez que Simba comprendió esto, ya no tuvo que ser persuadido. Supo lo que tenía que hacer a continuación y no miró atrás.</p>

<p>Este es el cambio que Dios espera que tenga lugar en cada uno de nosotros. En un libro de Escritura llamado la Perla de Gran Precio, se registra que el antiguo profeta Moisés tuvo una experiencia transformadora similar a la de Simba cuando Dios le mostró a Moisés la extensión de Sus incontables creaciones y le soltó una bomba diciéndole en la misma visión: “tú eres mi hijo... y tengo una obra para ti” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=spa&id=p4,p6#p4">Moisés 1:4, 6</a>). Moisés quedó abrumado por esta revelación, que lo dejó preguntándose y físicamente agotado. Pero Satanás se aprovechó de ese momento para atacar a Moisés, y a pesar de una rabia que sacudió la tierra y llenó a Moisés de pavor y miedo, Moisés clamó a Dios y reunió fuerzas en el conocimiento de Su relación con Él. “Soy hijo de Dios”, insistió, “a la semejanza de su Unigénito… ¡Apártate de aquí!” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=spa&id=p13-p22#p13">Moisés 1:13-22</a>).</p>

<p>Sin duda, este mismo conocimiento permitió a Moisés cumplir la misión para la que fue llamado: sacar a los israelitas de Egipto, darles la ley de Dios y establecerlos como pueblo en el proceso.</p>

<h2>Saber quién eres puede cambiar tu vida hoy</h2>

<p>Al igual que en estos ejemplos, nosotros también tenemos un linaje real. El apóstol Pablo escribió que en realidad somos “extranjeros y peregrinos sobre la tierra” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=spa&id=p13#p13">Hebreos 11:13</a>) —nuestro verdadero hogar se encuentra más allá de esta vida que conocemos. Nuestro destino es más grandioso de lo que podemos imaginar, y nuestro Padre dedica toda Su existencia a ayudarnos a alcanzarlo. Ver la vida de esta manera nos da poder para estar a la altura de este potencial.</p>

<p>Aquí tienes algunas maneras muy importantes en que tu vida puede cambiar hoy.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Siempre puedes contar con ayuda:</strong> ¡El Creador del universo es tu Padre! Él te ama y quiere que seas feliz. No te ha preparado para el fracaso. Puedes hablar con Él y recibir ayuda, seguridad, poder y consuelo en cualquier momento sobre cualquier cosa. El profeta Isaías dijo que cuando nos acercamos a Dios correctamente, “[podemos] llamar, y el Señor [responderá]; [podemos] clamar, y Él [dirá]: Heme aquí” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=spa&id=p9#p9">Isaías 58:9</a>). La conexión con Dios es real (mucho más que decir aquí más adelante).</li>

<li><strong>Puedes manejar cualquier comentario o crítica:</strong> Como hijo(a) de Dios, tu valor inherente y eterno no puede ser cambiado por nadie. La crítica (ya sea sobre tu vida personal, tu trabajo, tu crianza o cualquier otra cosa) puede ser escuchada con un corazón más tranquilo. Tu identidad no se ve amenazada por un fracaso temporal, lo que te permite aceptar comentarios constructivos más fácilmente y seguir intentándolo.</li>

<li><strong>No eres tu peor error:</strong> Las personas que nos rodean a veces nos juzgan por nuestro momento más bajo, pero Dios no. Esa cosa dolorosa que hiciste no es toda tu historia. La divinidad que hay en ti prospera al cambiar, crecer y llegar a ser. Dios, tu Padre, te ayudará. Tu historia está por delante para que la termines, y tiene un potencial increíble.</li>

<li><strong>La empatía se vuelve más fácil; los enemigos se desvanecen:</strong> Cuando miramos a alguien a través de la lente de su identidad eterna, dejamos de ver a un oponente o una estadística. Vemos a un hermano o una hermana que necesita ánimo y compañía en el mismo viaje de regreso a casa. Dios entiende y ama a tu pariente imposible, a cada conductor terrible, a ese patán en el trabajo y a todos los demás más profundamente de lo que ahora podemos entender. Solo recordar esto puede permitirnos respirar profundamente y ver con más compasión a la persona completa. Todos nos unimos al mismo equipo, y hay un futuro increíble posible para todos los que alguna vez has conocido (más sobre esto a continuación<sup>4</sup>).</li>

<li><strong>Tus talentos se convierten en una mayor responsabilidad y alegría:</strong> Ves tus habilidades —ya sea enfermería, escuchar, codificar, consolar a un amigo o cocinar— como dones de Dios destinados a traer felicidad y a ayudar a los otros hijos de Dios a lo largo de su jornada. Esto no es solo para autopromoción, avance profesional o simplemente para llenar nuestro tiempo libre. Esto transforma un pasatiempo o un amor en una oportunidad significativa para contribuir.</li>

<li><strong>Puedes terminar con la búsqueda frenética y adoptar la visión a largo plazo:</strong> Sabiendo que tu verdadero hogar y destino son eternos, la frenética búsqueda de validación, popularidad, títulos, los amigos “correctos”, patrimonio neto o la acumulación de cosas pierde su urgencia y atractivo. La forma en que empleas tu tiempo se mide en función de cosas que duran más: la calidad de tus relaciones más preciadas, la fuerza del carácter que estás forjando y la bondad que compartes con el mundo. Esta visión a largo plazo proporciona una paz profunda y te permite tomar plena posesión y una mayor satisfacción en cómo utilizas tu tiempo.</li>

<h2>Algunas reflexiones finales</h2>

<p>Como Padre perfecto, Dios desea muchísimo que Sus hijos regresen a Su hogar y encuentren gozo en el proceso. Debido a que Él sabe de lo que somos capaces, establece expectativas muy altas al mismo tiempo que ofrece compasión infinita, encontrándonos exactamente donde estamos.</p>

<p>Conocer esta idea arroja una luz importante sobre por qué la misión de Jesucristo es tan hermosa y necesaria. Mi título (actual) favorito de Jesús es “Emanuel” – que significa “Dios con nosotros” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/7?lang=spa&id=p14#p14">Isaías 7:14</a>). Cristo vino a <em>estar con nosotros</em>—a mostrarnos quiénes somos realmente y a tender un puente entre nuestra realidad rota e imperfecta y el glorioso potencial que todos tenemos como hijos de un Padre Celestial. Gracias a Él, nuestros errores, desafíos e incluso la muerte misma no tienen por qué detenernos cuando entendemos a dónde vamos en última instancia y cómo progresar hacia ello.</p>

<p>Nuevamente, hay mucho más de qué hablar sobre todo esto, pero un paso firme que cualquiera puede dar ahora mismo es recordar quién eres y recordar quién es también cualquier otra persona. Cuando hacemos eso, podemos practicar los dos grandes mandamientos (amar a Dios y amar a nuestro prójimo) con mayor comprensión y compasión. En el proceso, podemos descubrir, para nuestra sorpresa y alegría, que Dios tiene más en mente para nosotros de lo que jamás imaginamos para nosotros mismos.</p>

<h2>Notas</h2>

<ol>
<li>Como ha enseñado el presidente Russell M. Nelson, nuestra identidad más importante es la de ser hijos de Dios, seguida de ser hijos del convenio y, finalmente, discípulos de Jesucristo. Estas identidades trascienden a todas las demás. Recomiendo encarecidamente leer su discurso completo sobre este tema tan importante aquí (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=spa">Decisiones para la eternidad</a>, Russell M. Nelson, 2022).</li>

<li>“Élder” no es el primer nombre del Élder Patrick Kearon; es un título utilizado con los Apóstoles y algunos otros líderes de la iglesia de Cristo. También se utiliza con los misioneros, quienes comparten algo en común con los Apóstoles y algunos otros: son enviados a testificar de Jesucristo. Hay mucho más que decir sobre esto, pero es importante señalar que el título “Élder” fue dado asimismo a líderes con autoridad y responsabilidades especiales a medida que la Iglesia de Jesucristo se expandió después de la resurrección de Cristo (véase <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/20?lang=spa&id=p17#p17">Hechos 20:17</a> o <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/3?lang=spa&id=p1-p7#p1">1 Timoteo 3:1–7</a>).</li>

<li>La Oda de Wordsworth es una exploración de la existencia premortal del alma. Escribe que el niño conserva una conexión intuitiva con lo divino, viendo el mundo “vestido de luz celestial”. A medida que el niño madura, este resplandor visionario se desvanece en la “luz del día común”, pero el adulto gana una “mente filosófica” más profunda informada por el recuerdo de esa gloria perdida. Es una lucha recordar quiénes somos, y a menos que nos lo recordemos activamente, tenderemos naturalmente a olvidar, pero nuestros orígenes divinos permanecen con nosotros a pesar de todo. Es una hermosa ilustración de esta idea (<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45536/ode-intimations-of-immortality-from-recollections-of-early-childhood">Oda: Indicios de Inmortalidad por recuerdos de la primera infancia</a>, William Wordsworth, 1807).</li>

<li>Recordar también que Dios quiere que cada uno de nosotros llegue a ser como Él y que tenga lo que Él tiene, hace que esto sea aún más asombroso. C.S. Lewis puso esta realidad en un foco nítido: “Es algo serio vivir en una sociedad de posibles dioses y diosas, recordar que la persona más aburrida y menos interesante con la que puedas hablar puede llegar a ser algún día una criatura a la que, si la vieras ahora, te sentirías fuertemente tentado a adorar. . . . No hay gente común. Nunca has hablado con un simple mortal” (C.S. Lewis, <a href="https://www.doxaweb.com/assets/weight_of_glory.pdf">“El peso de la gloria”</a>, 1942).<br><br>¡Imagina lo que sucede si siempre vamos por la vida viendo a las personas de esta manera! No podríamos justificar tratar mal a nadie. El difunto rabino Jonathan Sacks enseñó que dado que somos creados a imagen de Dios, deshonrar a un ser humano es deshonrar a Dios mismo, y que dañar a otro ser humano podría incluso considerarse una forma de sacrilegio: faltarle el respeto a algo profundamente sagrado. No importa si creo que mi opinión en la vida diaria, la política o cualquier otra cosa es 100 % correcta y creo que la suya es 100 % incorrecta. No importa si sus elecciones de vida me ofenden. Las tácticas de odio, el desprecio o el desdén no son solo mala política o malos modales; son una desgracia directa para el Padre que nos ama a ambos.</li>

                title: 'Modern Apostles and Prophets: Living Proof of God’s Love',
                excerpt: 'Prophets? Now? It’s an incredible idea, isn’t it? The concept of living prophets in Christianity today...',
                content: `<p>Prophets? Now? It’s an incredible idea, isn’t it? The concept of living prophets in Christianity today is a bold claim. But it’s also a beautiful one.</p>

<p>Think about it. If God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and if He loves us as much as He loved the people in the Bible, why wouldn’t He speak to us now? We face challenges that Moses and Peter never imagined. We have questions unique to our time. Doesn’t it make sense that a loving Father would continue to guide His children?</p>

<p>The truth is, He does.</p>

<p>I want to share why I believe in living prophets and apostles, not just as a doctrinal point, but as a reality that has anchored my life.</p>

<h2>A Pattern of Love</h2>

<p>Throughout history, whenever God has had a people on earth, He has sent prophets to guide them. From Adam to Noah, Abraham to Moses, this has been His pattern. As the Bible says, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7">Amos 3:7</a>).</p>

<p>When Jesus Christ came to earth, He established His Church. He didn’t just leave a book; He called twelve apostles. He gave them authority to teach, to baptize, and to lead. He built His Church on the "foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/2?lang=eng&id=p20#p20">Ephesians 2:20</a>).</p>

<p>Why would that foundation be removed? If anything, we need it more today, not less.</p>

<h2>Witnesses of Christ</h2>

<p>The primary role of an apostle is to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world. This doesn’t mean they just teach about Him (though they do). It means they speak from a personal knowledge of His reality and His divinity.</p>

<p>In a world that is increasingly secular, confused, and cynical, hearing a voice of certain testimony is piercing. When I hear the apostles today testify of the Savior, I feel a confirmation in my own heart that He lives. Their words point me to Him. They don’t ask for followers for themselves; they ask us to follow Him.</p>

<h2>Guidance for Our Day</h2>

<p>One of the most comforting aspects of having living prophets is knowing that we are not left to figure out modern complexities alone. The Bible is the word of God, but it doesn’t explicitly mention AI, social media, the specific breakdown of the modern family, or the unique anxieties of the 21st century.</p>

<p>Living prophets apply eternal truths to our specific circumstances. They warn us of dangers we might not see. They encourage us when we feel overwhelmed.</p>

<p>For example, in recent years, we’ve been counseled to "Think Celestial"—to view our lives from an eternal perspective. We’ve been urged to "Let God Prevail" in our lives. We’ve been taught how to find peace in a turbulent world. These aren’t just catchy slogans; they are spiritual lifelines that have helped me navigate real struggles.</p>

<h2>They Are Imperfect Men Called by a Perfect God</h2>

<p>Sometimes people struggle with the idea of prophets because they see that these men are human. They are. They get sick, they age, they have personalities. Peter was impetuous. Jonah ran away. Moses had a stutter.</p>

<p>But God has always worked through imperfect people. That’s actually encouraging to me. If God can use them, maybe He can use me, too. The miracle isn’t that they are perfect; the miracle is that God speaks through them despite their imperfections.</p>

<h2>How to Know for Yourself</h2>

<p>You don’t have to take my word for it. In fact, you shouldn’t. The beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that it invites personal revelation.</p>

<p>You can listen to these men. You can read their words. And then you can ask God if they are His messengers. Jesus gave us a test for prophets: "By their fruits ye shall know them" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng&id=p20#p20">Matthew 7:20</a>).</p>

<p>What are the fruits of following their counsel? For me, the fruits have been peace, a stronger marriage, a clearer sense of purpose, and a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ. When I follow their teachings, I am a better man, husband, and father.</p>

<h2>An Invitation</h2>

<p>Twice a year, in April and October, we have a general conference where we hear from the prophet and apostles. It is available to everyone, everywhere, for free. I invite you to tune in. Listen with an open heart. See if you don’t feel something—a peace, a clarity, a sense of being known by God.</p>

<p>God is not silent. He loves us today just as much as He ever has. And because He loves us, He has sent watchmen on the tower to guide us home.</p>

                title: 'Why the Name “Outward and Upward?”',
                excerpt: 'In the last week of Jesus’ life, a lawyer asked Him a profound question: Master, which is the great commandment...',
                content: `<p>In the last week of Jesus’ life, a lawyer asked Him a profound question: "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"</p>

<p>Jesus’ answer was simple, yet it encompasses the whole duty of man:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22?lang=eng&id=p36-p39#p36">Matthew 22:36-39</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two commandments form the core of a disciple’s life. They give us direction. They give us purpose.</p>

<p>And they are the inspiration behind the name of this site: <strong>Outward and Upward</strong>.</p>

<h2>Upward: Loving God</h2>

<p>The "first and great commandment" is to love God. This is our vertical relationship. It is looking <strong>Upward</strong>.</p>

<p>To look upward is to seek God. It is to strive to know Him, to worship Him, and to align our will with His. It involves prayer, studying the scriptures, and keeping His commandments. It is an acknowledgment that we are His children and that He is the source of all light and truth.</p>

<p>When we look upward, we find our true identity. We find peace in the midst of storms. We find a love that is deeper and more enduring than anything the world can offer.</p>

<h2>Outward: Loving Our Neighbor</h2>

<p>The second commandment is "like unto it": to love our neighbor. This is our horizontal relationship. It is looking <strong>Outward</strong>.</p>

<p>To look outward is to see others as God sees them. It is to serve, to lift, and to comfort. It is to step outside of our own concerns and selfish desires to bless the lives of those around us.</p>

<p>True discipleship is not lived in isolation. It is lived in community. It is lived in our families, our neighborhoods, and our workplaces. As we look upward to God, He turns our gaze outward to His children.</p>

<h2>The Connection</h2>

<p>These two directions are inseparable. You cannot fully love God without loving His children. And you cannot fully love your neighbor without the power and perspective that comes from loving God.</p>

<p>As the Apostle John wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4?lang=eng&id=p20-p21#p20">1 John 4:20-21</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we look upward, we receive the love of God. When we look outward, we share that love with others. It is a beautiful cycle of receiving and giving, of being filled and pouring out.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>This site, <strong>Outward and Upward</strong>, is dedicated to exploring these two great themes. We want to help you look upward to find God and deepen your relationship with Him. And we want to inspire you to look outward to serve and love those around you.</p>

<p>Whether we are discussing scripture, sharing personal experiences, or commenting on current events, our goal is to point you in these two directions. We believe that by living outward and upward, we can find true joy and help build the kingdom of God on earth.</p>

<p>Join us on this journey. Let us look upward in faith and outward in love.</p>
