<h1>Modern Apostles and Prophets: Living Proof of God's Love</h1>
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Prophets? Now?</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s an incredible idea, isn’t it? The concept of living prophets in Christianity today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you think this sounds crazy, I don’t blame you. My first instinct is to question and take things apart, so it took
    a lot of personal experience and time for me to trust the evidence on living prophets. Now I am incredibly grateful
    for this gift. For me, the idea that God speaks to humanity today in the same way that He did through Moses, Isaiah,
    Paul and others is a miraculous demonstration of His love. Practically, it's also a source of peace and clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm writing about this because of recent, important events. On October 14, 2025, Dallin H. Oaks became the 18th
    President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This happened after President Russell M. Nelson passed
    away at 101 years old. Within my faith, both of these men are representatives of God and Christ as fully as any
    other prophet or apostle ever mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want to explain what this means for me, especially for anyone who might not be familiar with this idea.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Jesus Christ is the Foundation</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have to point out something critical first:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prophets point to Christ. That’s their mission. It’s what they do (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p43#p43">Acts 10:43</a>).
    In fact, the apostle John recorded in the Book of Revelation that "the testimony of Jesus <em>is</em> the spirit of
    prophecy" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10">Revelation
        19:10</a>, emphasis added). Another ancient prophet in the Book of Mormon wrote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">“And we talk of Christ⁠, we rejoice in Christ⁠, we preach of Christ⁠, we prophesy of
    Christ⁠, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a
    remission of their sins” (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&amp;id=p26#p26" title="">2
        Nephi 25:26</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prophets teach us to know, worship, follow, and love Christ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>An Ancient Pattern Continues Today</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t believe in a God who sees us as a science experiment, a cool hobby to show off in front of His friends, or a
    house pet. He is our Father. He wants to talk with us and be a part of our life! He wants to talk to you (1)
    personally (lots more on that to come), and also (2) by calling prophets. The Biblical prophet Amos wrote: “Surely
    the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7">Amos 3:7</a>). He’s
    done this from the beginning, pausing only in times when we've not been ready to listen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, when Jesus was on the earth, He set up His church on a “foundation of apostles and prophets” (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p13#p11">Ephesians
        4:11-13</a>). He chose twelve apostles, led by Peter (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p8#p1">Matthew
        10:1-8</a>, <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p19#p15">Matthew
        16:15-19</a>), and gave them the authority to lead His church.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This ancient pattern continues as today’s template. The president of the church is the senior apostle (like the
    apostle Peter), and there are also twelve apostles called to be prophets, with a special mission to testify of Jesus
    Christ and share God’s messages. Just like Peter, James, John, and Paul in the New Testament, apostles and prophets
    today testify of Jesus Christ and share God’s perspectives on what is taking place right now.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Wait… This raises a whole lot of questions.</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Definitely! And these deserve more thorough answers than can be recorded here, but I can try to rapid-fire a few.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"decimal","style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"16px"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"0","bottom":"0","left":"var:preset|spacing|80","right":"var:preset|spacing|80"},"margin":{"top":"0","bottom":"0"}}}} -->
<ol
    class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item {"style":{"spacing":{"margin":{"top":"0","bottom":"0"}}}} -->
    <li><b>Can’t we just personally pray and talk to God? Are prophets really
            necessary?</b><br>Yes! God wants to reveal things to you personally. If you pray, listen, and act on what
        you learn through the Holy Spirit your life will change (again, tons to discuss later). Still, God also has a
        lot to say that applies to all of us. This allows Him to help us accomplish more together, reach us when we’re
        not very receptive to God, and give us a clear path to more of His will and perspective. Prophets make this
        possible, and it’s a tremendous gift!</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item {"style":{"spacing":{"margin":{"top":"0","bottom":"0"}}}} -->
    <li><b>But can anyone just call themselves a prophet? How does this
            work?</b><br>I suppose I could grab a megaphone and a camera crew and call myself a modern prophet, but I
        wouldn’t be one – even if I somehow convinced millions of people that I were. Only God, through Christ and those
        called by Christ can call another apostle or prophet. This is exactly why Christ set up a church and gave His
        apostles authority – to baptize, to act in power, to give the Holy Ghost, and also to call new apostles (<a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10?lang=eng">Matthew 10</a>, <a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p17-p20#p17">Acts
            8:17-20</a>,<a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p14#p14">1 Timothy
            4:14</a>, <a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p15-p26#p15">Acts
            1:15-26</a>).<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup><br>The original 12 apostles were personally called
        by Christ. Because of the holy responsibility they had from God, they were authorized to receive revelation to
        call new apostles when there was a vacancy. This principle is the same today. There are apostles called today,
        and it turns out, all of them are ordained as prophets. They testify of Christ, receive revelation from God in
        that important role, and they council together about important matters. The most senior apostle, however, is a
        prophet with a special responsibility to receive revelation for the entire church of Christ: a prophet with
        capital “P” so to speak. This senior apostle is always the longest tenured apostle, so there is no voting or
        question about who is the next prophet when a current prophet dies. The person who has been an apostle for the
        longest period of time will be the next prophet. So who really chooses the next prophet? God does, because he
        controls the timing of passing into the next life.<sup id="fnref3a"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item {"style":{"spacing":{"margin":{"top":"0","bottom":"0"}}}} -->
    <li><b>But wait, what’s been going on for the last 2000 or so years?</b><br>The
        gospel of Jesus Christ has spread marvelously, and countless men and women made sacrifices to accomplish this.
        That said, most of this happened without apostles or a living prophet. The original apostles were killed in
        time, and people commonly disagreed about many points of belief. Because conditions weren’t right, God waited to
        call another prophet and set of apostles. When the time and place was right, God called Joseph Smith in 1820 and
        again established Christ's church as the Church of Jesus Christ - the same one as when He was on the earth, but
        now in the last or "latter" days. This brought back the responsibility and authorization to receive direction
        for the world as a whole and act using the power that Christ gave to prophets and apostles throughout history.
        There have been authorized successors to the apostles and prophets since that time, and Christ has said that
        this would continue until He comes again (<a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p1#p1">D&amp;C
            13:1</a>).</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>So what are prophets actually saying in modern times?</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot! Like ancient prophets and apostles, they often help us apply what God and Christ have already said - but
    adapted to the world as it is today. This very often is a call to change or repent. Sometimes they reveal new things
    that Christ would have us do because it will bless us. Sometimes they warn about things that are coming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no adequate way to cover this, but I’ll directly quote a smattering of examples from the last few years, in
    reverse chronological order. Most are from President Russell M. Nelson, the prophet who passed away within the last
    few weeks at the time of writing. I encourage anyone to read the full sermons linked for more context.</p>

<p>While prophets and apostles travel around the world to share messages under specific circumstances, twice a year

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Some Parting Thoughts</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I've discussed, the fact that God calls prophets today is ultimately a sign that He loves us. He is deeply
    invested in our happiness. He wants to be a part of our lives. Your life, too! It is a remarkable blessing that
    might sound fantastic and mind-blowing to some, but it can also be so natural that I and others actually risk taking
    this miracle for granted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Returning again to the earlier idea – prophets point to Christ; they share God’s perspective for us in our day; their
    very existence is mighty evidence of God’s love and concern for all of His children. That said, as extraordinary and
    essential as the prophets' role is, they would be the first to tell you that they are not to be worshiped or
    mindlessly followed. Just as Christ always pointed to His Father (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng&amp;id=p26-p29#p26" title="">John
        8:26-29</a>) prophets always point to Christ. As we pay attention to Christ's representatives, It is a personal
    responsibility to seek our own relationship with God and gain a personal knowledge of Christ’s teachings. Our goal
    is to develop a deep connection with God individually so His spirit can confirm to us truth as we seek it out from
    prophets, scripture, personal revelation, other sources of truth of all kinds, and our own desires to do good.
    Knowledge gained in this way will stay with us and shape who we are and what we do, because it is put in our hearts
    by God. When all is said and done, our journey of faith is ultimately ours to make.</p>

        <li id="fn1">There is a fascinating story in Acts Chapter 8 about someone who saw that Peter had the authority
            to give the Gift of the Holy Ghost and wanted to pay Peter to receive that power himself. “And when Simon
            saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, saying,
            Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said unto
            him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
            Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God” (<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/8?lang=eng&id=p18-p21#p18">Acts
                8:18-21</a>).</li>
        <li>Starting in the days of Adam, there were many generations of prophets, through to Noah. In time, though,
            prophetic guidance was rejected, and God directly called again Abraham, from whom we see a line of great
            patriarchs that established the people of Israel (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph). Then there was a gap until
            Moses was called by Jehovah out of the burning bush, which led to a succession of guidance from Moses to
            Joshua, who was also considered a prophet and for whom the River Jordan parted just like the Red Sea parted
            for Moses (<a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/3?lang=eng&id=p9-p17#p9">Joshua
                3:9-17</a>). We could name other lines. Samuel who passed the baton to Nathan, Elijah who called Elisha,
            and many others. If the prophets are taken away, God will call another one as soon as they will be listened
            to.</li>

                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/how-a-prophet-is-chosen?lang=eng">here</a>. Know,
            however, that it really is straightforward - the most senior apostle becomes the next prophet. It’s
            incredible that this is completely free of political drama or uncertainty. God really does control the
            process.</li>
