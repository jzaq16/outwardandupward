<h2>The ocean chose . . . three-year-old (?)</h2>

<p>My small daughter has recently been on a Moana kick (yes, the character from Disney Movie). It is
    <em>not</em> casual. When she's in the zone, she <em>is</em> Moana. If I call her name, she'll flip around in her
    full islander outfit, heroically brandishing some kind of stick for a paddle, and retort:
</p>

<p>"No, Maui! I'm Moana! And <em>we</em> need to fight Te Kā!"</p>

<p>Her stuffed kitty becomes either "Pua" or "Heyhey," and she is relentlessly determined to fulfill her
    mission–bestowed by the ocean itself–to restore the heart of Te Fiti.</p>

<p>Now, this is totally age-appropriate imaginative play, but it's also incredible how much determination and confidence
    this play-identity brings out in my tiny daughter.</p>

<p>Identities are powerful.</p>

<h2>Your Identity as a Child of God</h2>

<p>But what if it weren't a fantasy? Confidence in who you are can unlock lasting peace and nearly boundless potential.
</p>

<p>Here's a foundational truth that can give you this confidence.</p>

<p><strong>You. Are. God's. Child.<br>His Daughter or His Son.</strong></p>

<p>This isn't speculation. When Christ Himself was accused of masquerading as the son of God, He pointed His accusers
    back to their own scriptures to remind them of their own potential: [It's not just me!] "Ye [yourselves] are gods,
    children of the most High" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p34#p34">John 10:34</a>, <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/82?lang=eng&id=p6#p6">Psalm 82:6</a>).</p>

<p>Yes, we are talking about the same God who "created the heaven and the earth" and who has "all power" and "all
    knowledge," and who is infinitely <em>good</em>, among a lot of other things we could say (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11">1 Chronicles
        29:11-12</a>, <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p20-p22#p20">Daniel 2:20-22</a>,
    <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1">D&C
        38:1-3</a>, <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Mosiah 4:9</a>, <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3">Mosiah 5:3</a>,
    etc.).
</p>

<p>Yes. That person is your father. Your parent. Who loves you and who wants your happiness. This identity as a child of
    God is the <a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng">most
        important identity</a><sup>1</sup> you will ever have, according to a prophet of God.</p>

<p>Think for a second what this actually means! To help, I'm going to quote an apostle:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That truth is breathtaking! Stunning! And it is not figurative . . . You really are His cherished daughter. You
        really are His precious son. And the path you are on is His plan of happiness. With His omniscient love, He
        knows exactly who you were before you were sent to earth and what you have experienced so far in your mortal
        life, and He has mercifully planned for your every tomorrow. And oh, how He yearns to one day have you return to
        Him, to receive the supreme intent of all His beautiful gifts, eternal life with Him.</p>

    <p>- Elder Patrick Kearon, <a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/55kearon?lang=eng"><em>Receive
                His Gift</em></a>, April 2025</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>But what does this mean exactly?</h2>

<p>In that quote, Elder<sup>2</sup> Kearon said some things that might sound surprising, including the fact that God has
    a "plan of happiness," and that he knew you "before you were sent to earth."</p>

<p>When we say that God is your father, it's important to clarify that He is the father of your spirit. This mortal body
    won't last forever, but your spirit is a part of you that existed before you were born and will continue after you
    die. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Hebrews 12:9</a>).
</p>

<p>Ancient scriptures are filled with people—from Moses on a mountain to Jesus teaching the crowds—who were reminded of
    this divine potential. Here are a few examples:</p>

<h3>You lived with God before you came to Earth</h3>

<p>"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I
    ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). The
    Lord gave these bold words to a stunned soon-to-be prophet Jeremiah, who likely was only a teenager when he had this
    encounter with the Lord around 627 BC. This isn't unique to Jerimiah, it's true for you and all of us!</p>

<p>Modern prophets clarify what has been known for centuries–that "even before [we] were born, [we] received [our] first
    lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come [to the Earth] in the due time of the Lord" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng&id=p56#p56">D&C
        138:56</a>).</p>

<p>It's this same sacred idea that poet William Wordsworth captured when he wrote that "trailing clouds of glory do we
    come from God, who is our home" (Ode: Intimations of Immortality<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>There is much more to say about this, but know for now that God knew us and loved us before we came here, and that
    this experience on Earth is an important step we chose to take in learning to become more like our Father.</p>

<h3>Your spirit knows where it came from</h3>

<p>But how could anyone possibly believe this? The Apostle Paul told the Romans that "[God's Holy] Spirit itself beareth
    witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
    with Christ" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?lang=eng&id=p16-p17#p16">Romans
        8:16-17</a>).</p>

<p>Paul's incredible observation is that God is reaching out directly to your eternal self to tell you who you are. In
    quiet, peaceful moments you can know in your mind and feel in your heart that you are not an anonymous accident in a
    cold universe. You are deeply loved by your Father in Heaven.</p>

<p>Like many others, I feel the pull of this message when I gaze into the stars from the Santa Cruz Mountains, or I see
    the sun set over the ocean from the cliffs near Pacifica, or look up from a forest floor into a cluster of sequoias,
    but I also feel it in the hug I give to my daughters, or in quiet of my bedside as I pray to connect with God
    directly and tell Him what is on my mind.</p>

<p>But Paul also shares a startling implication. As a child of God, you are also an <em>heir</em> of God. God wants you
    to <em>inherit</em> all that He
    has–all the blessings that He enjoys. He lives for your <em>happiness</em>. This earth was made for <em>you</em>.
    Everything that He does and everything He has said is to bless you and His other children (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p24-p33#p24">2 Nephi
        26:24-33</a>).</p>

<h3>Your identity gives you power and purpose</h3>

<p>So how does this affect my life? Well, that depends on whether you <em>let</em> it change you.</p>

<p>Here's a quick illustration from another Disney Film (remember, I have young kids). Simba from <em>The Lion King</em>
    thought he had it made. He lived in a beautiful place. He had friends who accepted him. He had "no worries" to speak
    of. But when his childhood friend Nala showed up and asked him to save his former home from his conniving uncle,
    Simba was pained and angry.</p>

<p>His life changed immediately and permanently when he was reminded who he was. His murdered father Mufasa (in the
    booming voice of the late James Earl Jones) essentially told him:</p>

<p>"I know you love me, but you've forgotten me. If you remembered who I really am, you would have remembered that you
    were born to become something more than this! Sure, you can chill in the jungle and eat bugs with your friends, but
    you have a destiny and a purpose. That purpose is to be a king."</p>

<p>Once Simba got this, he didn't have to be persuaded anymore. He knew what he needed to do next, and he didn't look
    back.</p>

<p>This is the change that God hopes will take place in each of us. In a book of scripture called the Pearl of Great
    Price, the ancient prophet Moses is recorded as having a life-changing Simba-like experience when God shows Moses
    the extent of his countless creations and drops a bombshell by telling him in same vision "thou art my son . . . and
    I have a work for three" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p4,p6#p4">Moses 1:4,6</a>).
    Moses was floored by this revelation, which left him wondering and physically drained. But Satan took advantage of
    that moment to attack Moses, and despite a rage that shook the earth and filled Moses with dread and fear, Moses
    called out to God and summoned strength in the knowledge of His relationship with Him. "I am a son of God," he
    pressed, "in the similitude of his Only Begotten . . . get thee hence[!]" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p13-p22#p13">Moses
        1:13-22</a>).</p>

<p>No doubt this same knowledge enabled Moses to fulfil the mission he was called to take on, of taking the Israelites
    out of Egypt, giving them God's law, and establishing them as a people in the process.</p>

<h2>Knowing who you are can change your life today</h2>

<p>Like in these examples, we also have a royal lineage. The apostle Paul wrote that we are actually "strangers and
    pilgrims on the earth" (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13">Hebrews 11:13</a>)—our
    true home lies beyond this life that we know. Our destiny is grander than we can imagine. and our Father devotes his
    entire existence to helping us towards it. Seeing life in this way empowers us to live up to this potential.</p>

<p>Here are a few very important ways your life can change today.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>You can always have help:</strong> The creator of the universe is your father! He loves you and wants
        you to be happy. He hasn't set you up for failure. You can talk to Him and receive help, assurance, power, and
        comfort at any time about anything. The prophet Isaiah said that when we approach God correctly, "[we can] call,
        and the Lord [will] answer; [we can] cry, and he [will] say, Here I am" (<a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=eng&id=p9#p9">Isaiah 58:9</a>).
        Connection with God is real (lots more to say here later).</li>

    <li><strong>You can handle any feedback or criticism:</strong> As a child of God, your inherent, eternal worth can't
        be changed by anyone. Criticism (whether about your personal life, your work, your parenting, or something else)
        can be heard with a calmer heart. Your identity isn't threatened by a temporary failure, allowing you to accept
        constructive feedback more easily and keep trying.</li>

    <li><strong>You are not your worst mistake:</strong> The people around us sometimes judge us by our lowest moment,
        but God doesn't. That painful thing you did is not your whole story. The divinity inside you thrives on
        changing, growing, becoming. God, your father, will help you. Your story is ahead of you to finish, and it has
        incredible potential.</li>

    <li><strong>Empathy becomes easier; enemies vanish:</strong> When we look at someone through the lens of their
        eternal identity, we stop seeing an opponent or a statistic. We see a brother or a sister who needs
        encouragement and companionship on the same journey home. God understands and loves your impossible relative,
        each terrible driver, that jerk at work, and all others more deeply than we can now understand. Just remembering
        this can allow us to take a deep breath and see more compassionately the whole person. We all joined the same
        team, and there's an incredible future possible for everyone you've ever met (more on this below<sup>4</sup>).
    </li>

    <li><strong>Your talents become a greater responsibility–and joy:</strong> You see your skills—whether it's nursing,
        listening, coding, comforting a friend, or cooking—as gifts from God intended to bring happiness and to help
        God's other children along their journey. This isn't just for self-promotion, career advancement, or to merely
        fill our free time. This changes a hobby or a love into a meaningful chance to contribute.</li>

    <li><strong>You can end the rat race and take the long view:</strong> Knowing your true home and destiny are
        eternal, the frenetic pursuit of validation, popularity, titles, the "right" friends, net worth, or the
        accumulation of things loses its urgency and luster. How you spend your time becomes measured against things
        that last longer: the quality of your most cherished relationships, the strength of your character you are
        building, and the goodness you share with the world. This long view provides deep peace and allows you to take
        full ownership of and greater fulfillment in where your time goes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a perfect parent, God wants so badly for His children to come home to Him and to find joy in the process. Because
    he knows what we are capable of, He sets very high expectations while simultaneously offering infinite compassion,
    meeting us exactly where we are.</p>

<p>Knowing this idea sheds some important light on why Jesus Christ's mission is so beautiful and necessary. My
    (current) favorite title of Jesus is "Immanuel" – which means "God with us (<a
        href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14">Isaiah 7:14</a>).
    Christ came to <em>be with us</em>–to show us who we really are and to bridge the gap between our broken, imperfect
    reality and the glorious potential we all have as children of a Father in heaven. Because of Him, our mistakes,
    challenges, and even death itself don't have to hold us back when we understand where we're ultimately going and how
    to progress toward it.</p>

<p>Again, there is much more to talk about with all of this, but a strong step that anyone can take right now is to
    remember who you are and to remember who everyone else is, too. When we do that, we can practice the two great
    commandments (loving God and loving our neighbor) with increased understanding and compassion. In the process we can
    discover, to our surprise and joy, that God has more in mind for us than we ever imagined for ourselves.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
    <li>As President Russell M. Nelson has taught, our most important identity is that of a child of God, followed by
        being a child of the covenant, and finally, a disciple of Jesus Christ. These identities transcend all others. I
        highly recommend reading his full address on this very important topic here (<a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng">Choices
            for Eternity</a>, Russel M. Nelson, 2022).</li>

    <li>"Elder" is not Elder Patrick Kearon's first name; it's a title used with Apostles and some other leaders in
        Christ's church. It is also used with Missionaries, who share something in common with Apostles and some
        others–they are sent out to testify of Jesus Christ. There is much more to say on this, but it is important to
        note that the title "Elder" was likewise given to leaders with special authority and responsibilities as teh
        Church of Jesus Christ expanded after Christ's resurrection (see <a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/20?lang=eng&id=p17#p17">Acts 20:17</a> or
        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p7#p1">1 Timothy
            3:1–7</a>).
    </li>

    <li>Wordsworth's Ode is an exploration of the soul's pre-mortal existence. He writes that the child retains an
        intuitive connection to the divine, seeing the world "Apparelled in celestial light." As the child matures, this
        visionary gleam fades into the "light of common day," but the adult gains a deeper "philosophic mind" informed
        by the memory of that lost glory. It is a fight to remember who we are, and unless we are actively reminding
        ourselves, we will naturally tend to forget, but our divine origins stay with us nevertheless. It's a beautiful
        illustration of this idea (<a
            href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45536/ode-intimations-of-immortality-from-recollections-of-early-childhood">Ode:
            Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood</a>, William Wordsworth, 1807).</li>

    <li>Remembering also that God wants each of us to become like him and to have what he has, makes this even more
        mind-blowing. C.S. Lewis put this reality into sharp focus: "It is a serious thing to live in a society of
        possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one
        day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no
        ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal" (C.S. Lewis, <a
            href="https://www.doxaweb.com/assets/weight_of_glory.pdf">"The Weight of Glory"</a>, 1942).<br><br>Imagine
        what happens If we always go through life seeing people this way! We couldn't justify treating anyone poorly.
        The late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks taught that since we are created in the image of God, to dishonour a human being
        is to dishonour God Himself, and that harming another human being could even be thought of as a form of
        sacrilege–disrespecting something deeply holy. It doesn't matter if I think my opinion in daily life, politics
        or anything else is 100% correct and I think theirs is 100% wrong. It doesn't matter if their life choices
        offend me. Hateful tactics, contempt, or dismissiveness aren't just bad politics or bad manners; they are a
        direct disgrace to the Father who loves us both.</li>
