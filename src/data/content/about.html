<p>Hi, I'm Derek! I'm a tech worker in the California Bay Area, but far more importantly, I'm a Christian, a husband,
    and a parent. When I'm not with my family, I enjoy trying new tech, appreciating nature, and exploring new ideas.
</p>

<p>My goal is simple: to build bridges of connection by sharing down-to-earth perspectives on Christian living and faith
    in real life. Naturally, a lot of this will relate to my experiences as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of
    Latter-day Saints (sometimes called "Mormons"). In part, I hope I can help demystify my faith in an accessible and
    genuine way for anyone who has ever wondered about it.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the thoughts I share here are my own; I don't speak for my church. But my faith is
    central to who I am, and I'll frequently refer to the scriptures and other sources that guide and inspire me.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. I hope you'll join the conversation!</p>
